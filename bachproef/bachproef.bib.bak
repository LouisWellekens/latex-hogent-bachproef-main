blockchain, technology to enable a secure transaction. Although the technology
is widely misunderstood, many central banks are considering launching their own
national cryptocurrency. In contrast to most data in financial economics, detailed
data on the history of every transaction in the cryptocurrency complex are freely
available. Furthermore, empirically-oriented research is only now beginning, presenting an extraordinary research opportunity for academia. We provide some insights
into the mechanics of cryptocurrencies, describing summary statistics and focusing
on potential future research avenues in financial economics.},

  abstract    = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of
decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory.
Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with
the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are
merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This
tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure
gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally
discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency,
called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is
presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value
is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are
replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly
convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are
generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of l},

payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
